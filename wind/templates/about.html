            <p>I'm a software engineer at Google.</p>
            <p>It would seem I don't post much here! I mean to change that. When I do post it will most likely be about technology, questionable ways of thinking, and other things I'm not particularly qualified to comment upon.</p>
            <p>I'm always trying to learn. Reading is great, but perhaps writing is better. If you write something down it forces you to make your own thoughts somewhat coherent.</p>
