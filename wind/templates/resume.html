        <h3 class="resume-section-header">SUMMARY</h3>
            <p>I am a full stack developer. I love learning new technologies and putting them into action. I'm most experienced with Python and Javascript, but I'm always trying to expand my knowledge base.
        <h3 class="resume-section-header">EXPERIENCE</h3>
            <p><strong>Keep</strong>, Full Stack Developer, April 2013 &mdash; Present (<a class="article-link" href="http://keep.com">www.keep.com</a>)</p>
            <p>I was originally hired as a front-end developer at Keep. After 8 months of working on the web front-end and back-end, I moved onto our data team. I now work on web crawlers, data processing, and machine learning problems.</p>
            <p>Given an arbitrary URL, my partner on the data team and I have been able to build tools that allow us to determine if the page represents a product, if that product is available for purchase, and how much it costs. All with total accuracy measures in the mid-90s.</p>
            <p><strong>Gigsmash</strong>, Co-founder, 2011 &mdash; 2013</p>

            <p>Gigsmash was a local live music search engine. It helped people find shows in their area by letting them filter local listings, vote for their favorites, and listen to the band's music before they went. Shows were displayed in both list and map format.</p>
            <p>I worked on any and everything at Gigsmash. I helped build the back-end, design the front-end, build the mobile version, plan the user experience, and market the project.</p>

        <h3 class="resume-section-header">ABOUT ME</h3>
            <p>While working on Gigsmash, I also gained some education experience by working part-time as an SAT/ACT tutor. My tutoring was done one on one and I worked with students on both the math and verbal sections of the test.</p>
            <p>Prior to discovering my love for programming, I supported myself through online poker. Winning at poker requires accurate pattern recognition, quick decision making, staying calm under pressure, and a dedication to learning.</p>
            <p>My interests include travel and the outdoors. I have taken extended trips to Australia and New Zealand, Peru and Bolivia, and the American West. I enjoy hiking, climbing, photography, and generally exploring the world.</p>
