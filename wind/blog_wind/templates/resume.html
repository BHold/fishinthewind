        <h3 class="resume-section-header">SUMMARY</h3>
            <p>I am a self-taught full stack web developer. I love learning new technologies and putting them into action. My first attempt at a startup, Gigsmash, hasn't gained much traction so I'm interested in joining another project.</p>

        <h3 class="resume-section-header">EXPERIENCE</h3>
            <p><b>Gigsmash LLC</b>, Co-founder, 2011 - Present (<a class="article-link" href="www.gigsmash.com">www.gigsmash.com</a>)</p>

            <p>Gigsmash is a local live music search engine. It helps people to find shows in their area by letting them filter our listings, vote for their favorites, and listen to the band's music before they go. Shows can be displayed in both list and map format.</p>
            <p>I've worked on any and everything at Gigsmash. I've helped build the back-end, design the front-end, build the mobile version, plan the user experience, and market the project.</p>
            <p>Search for Burlington, VT at Gigsmash to get a good example of the site. That's the only location that currently has many shows listed, unfortunately!</p>

        <h3 class="resume-section-header">ABOUT ME</h3>
            <p>While working on Gigsmash, I also gained some education experience by working part-time as an SAT/ACT tutor. My tutoring was done one on one and I worked with students on both the math and verbal sections of the test.</p>
            <p>Prior to discovering my love for web development, I supported myself through online poker. Winning at poker requires accurate pattern recognition, quick decision making, staying calm under pressure, and a dedication to learning.</p>
            <p>My interests include travel and the outdoors. I have taken extended trips to Australia and New Zealand, Peru and Bolivia, and the American West. I enjoy hiking, climbing, photography, and generally exploring the world.</p>
