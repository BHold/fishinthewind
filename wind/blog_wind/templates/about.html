        <p>I'm a web developer and beginning blogger.</p>
        <p>I mostly use Python and JavaScript, and love working with both (though I'm always playing with new stuff).</p>
        <p>My little startup attempt, <a class="article-link" href="https://www.gigsmash.com">Gigsmash</a>, didn't gain much traction, so I'm currently looking for a job in the New York area. If you'd like to talk, <a class="article-link" href="mailto:bhold45@gmail.com">get in touch</a>!</p>
        <p>Some non-programming stuff I like: travel, nature, climbing, reading, hiking, photography, art.</p>
